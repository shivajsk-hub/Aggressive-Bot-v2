# Aggressive-Bot-v2
Arduino-powered 6-servo combat robot simulation in Tinkercad with LCD and sensor integration
# Aggressive-Bot-v2 ðŸ¤–

*Arduino-powered 6-servo combat robot simulation* built in *Tinkercad*, featuring:
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Ultrasonic Sensor for distance detection
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- Tilt & Light sensors
- 6 continuous servo motion with power management
- Optional buzzer feedback

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- *Aggressive Mode:* Simulates attack patterns every 5 seconds.
- *Servo Power Management:* Smooth movement to prevent power spikes.
- *LCD HUD:* Displays robot mode, temperature, and servo sweep percentage.
- *Sensors:* Ultrasonic for range detection, TMP36 for temperature, tilt & light sensors for environmental feedback.
- *DEMO Mode:* Runs a showcase cycle for presentations and video recording.
